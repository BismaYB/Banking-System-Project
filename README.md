**Code strutures**

This program code is written in python,python is a simple and platform independent language.
object oriented programming(oops) concept used this program so easily understand and data is very secured
each banking opertion is organized into functions.
the user deatils is stored in dictionary 'user'
the main function is 'user_account' ,it's a menu driven interface for user interaction
user to access all the function.


__Notes__

This code does not implement advanced security features of real banking system, its a replicate banking system created for mini project
user data not  persistently stored ;it's lost when program is terminates
